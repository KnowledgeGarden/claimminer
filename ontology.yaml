# This is both an analysis of existing data patterns (Phrasings copyright Society Library)
# And a proposal for future data patterns (Collective?)
# Note 1: In case when the source is a category, we should probably allow to use grandparent type.
# Note 2: question should always include claim in closed question form as well as open question.
Link groups:
  # Existing
  - truth
  - relevance
  - generic  # to be removed
  - freeform  # to be kept for progressive formalization but marked
  # Proposed
  - necessity  # subcase of truth
  - premise  # replaces argument<-generic-claim
  - refine  # subcase, still abstract
  - specific  # concrete instance. Maybe apply to FactualClaim subtype of Claim?
  - components  # subcomponents (eg phases of a plan)
  - consider  # relevant fact or question, i.e. confirmed freeform
  - answers  # replaces open question<-generic<-claim
  - meaningfulness  # is the previous claim/question based on flawed assumptions?
  - interpret  # a more precise reading which is not a strict subcase
  - has_theme  # the theme applies to the node
  - show_theme  # We will show the theme under the node
